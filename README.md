## Description

### Overview

This document describes how to create a Performance insight OEE analysis dashboard.
With the key figure of Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), you can calculate the productivity of a plant or its losses and display them transparently using the Gantt widget. The OEE widgets are predefined, only a few parameters have to be defined in the OEE settings.

The overall equipment effectiveness of a plant is defined as the product of the following three factors:
- Availability factor (e.g. whether there are fault times)
- Performance factor (e.g. whether the system is running at full load or reduced load)
- Quality factor (e.g. how much scrap is produced)

### General task

This example is a supplement to Performance Insight getting started see [performance-insight-getting-started](https://github.com/industrial-edge/performance-insight-getting-started).
For the Performance Insight OEE analysis, [this](#tia-project) TIA project is required.
In Performance Insight, the OEE analysis settings are configured and then displayed as a dashboard.

## Requirements

###  Prerequisities

- Access to an Industrial Edge Management System (IEM)
- Onboarded Industial Edge Device on IEM
- Performance Insight getting started [performance-insight-getting-started](https://github.com/industrial-edge/performance-insight-getting-started)

### Used components

- Industrial Edge Management (IEM) V1.2.16 (OS) V1.2.0-36
  - IE Databus V1.2.16
  - IE Databus Configurator V1.2.29
  - S7 Connector V1.2.26
  - S7 Connector Configurator V1.2.38
  - Data Service V1.2.0
  - Performance Insight V1.2.1
- Industrial Edge Device V 1.2.0-56
- TIA Portal V16
- CPU 1511-1 PN

### TIA Project

The used TIA Portal project can be found in the [miscellenous repository](https://github.com/industrial-edge/miscellaneous/tree/main/tank%20application) and is also used for several further application examples.

## Configuration steps

You can find further information about the following steps [here](docs/Installation.md)
- Configure Data Service
- Configure Performance Insight
- Display OEE dashboard

## Usage

Once the Data Service app is configured and data is availalbe from a running PLC, process data can be collected.
Performance Insight visualises this data in an OEE dashboard.
